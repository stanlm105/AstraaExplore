Exploring the cosmos via accessibility materials, tools, pipelines, and more to come.

Welcome to AstraaExplore! 

Hi, my name is Mike. This journey is notes about my personal exploration of the night sky with milestones and goals. 
There are many different avenues one could take in this topic, that's part of the beauty of it! I can't say whether or not the avenue that I present here will be best for everyone, or not. 
In a nutshell, the avenue of my journey is exploring via a manual dobsonian telescope. To start with the classic exercise of the Messier Observing Program to log and sketch the 110 objects, followed/accompanied by astrophotography.
I will freely add materials, tools, utilities here that aid me in the journey.

Roadmap:

Quest 1: Messier Observing Program
    a. Youtube Channel
        Coming soon. For those opting for longer play background narration, documenting my journey to certification of the messier observing program by Astronomical League
    b. Messier Logbook Generator
        Coming soon. Small utility to generate a personalized log book for recording one's journey.
        Format: Docker / GCS / Cloud Run
        User interface: Web
        Free
    c. Messier Target Guidance Computer
        Coming soon. Small utility to auto-suggest the best Messier target to try given one's current location and the remaining objects remaining in one's quest.
        Format: Docker / GCS / Cloud Run / Cloud SQL
        User interface: Web
        Free

Quest 2: Dobsonian Astrophotography
    a. Image Stacking Pipeline Utilities
        Aimed at stacking images geared towards output from Dobsonian mounted micro four thirds DSLR exposures (as opposed to FIPS/SmartScope sources)
        Aimed at being pragmatic and simple, not that this is better or worse than a different approach, just wishing to help beginners and accessibility.
        Format: TBD
        User interface: TBD
        Free
