> Hi, my name is Mike. MessierExplore is a personal astronomy journey turned open toolkit — offering logbooks, sky guidance, and astrophotography utilities. Free, beginner-friendly, and built with Python + cloud tools.<br><br>
> There are many different avenues one could take in this topic, which is fascinating. I'm intrigued by Red Cat's high production products, I'm intrigued by the automated pipelines and precise EQ tracking of SmartScopes. That said, the focus of the explorations here will be through that of the classic dobsonian. <br><br>
> The first quest in this journey is the classic exercise of the Messier Observing Program for manually logging and sketching the 110 Messier objects of the night sky.<br><br>
> The side quest is exploring astrophotography and will share both triumphs and challenges.<br><br>
> I will freely add materials, tools, utilities here that aid in the journey.<br><br>

## Tools for Everyone

> One page, easy access. No install required.

### 1) Messier Observing Logbook (PDF)
- **What it is:** Printable, numbered logbook (110 objects), with full-page notes & sketch area, and a clean cover.
- **Get it Free:** https://ms-ms-gh-me-logbook-696367436779.us-east4.run.app
- **Code:** Located in this repository as a python command-line script, and then as a web service; see files named logbook.
- **Features:** personalized cover page, checklist, per-object log pages, clean typography.

### 2) Messier Target Guidance Computer (Web App)
- **What it is:** All your viewing condition info and suggestion for next best Messier target from your remaining targets based on many meteorlogical factors pulled from free sources on the web.
- **Try it:** (link when live)  
- **Inputs:** location; **Outputs:** Ranked list, conditions<br><br>

> 🚀 **Why Target Guidance Computer is Exciting**  
> The Target Guidance Computer is more than a Messier checklist – it’s a smart companion that combines astronomy math with real-world conditions.  
> At a glance you’ll know: ✨ what you haven’t logged yet, 🌙 which objects sit high and clear of the Moon, and ☁️ how tonight’s clouds, darkness, and sky quality affect your session.  
> With nothing more than a passphrase and your postal code, the tool personalizes your observing journey, tracks your “seen” list, and serves up the best targets for today at **9 PM local time**.  
> 💡 Lightweight, free, and built to grow – practical backend engineering powering human-friendly exploration of the night sky.

### 3) Dobsonian Astrophotography — Simple Stacking Utils (CLI, GUI.. tbd)
- **What it is:** Lightweight, beginner-friendly image stacking pipeline for Dobsonian + MFT DSLR. For myself I'm planning micro four thirds adapter to keep weight down. Dobsonian is not expected to be best choice for astrophotography, but like a manual transmission car, I'd like to explore what steps optimize the fun and results even if it might not outclass dedicated rigs and smartscopes.
- **Download:** (link to release binary or quickstart)
